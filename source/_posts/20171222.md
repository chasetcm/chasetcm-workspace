那么，问题来了，鸡是怎么进入十二生肖名单的呢？ 其实鸡的入选与本期主题--**鸡鸣**有很大关系呢！

>据说某日，玉帝要册封生肖，名额只有十二个，主要挑选那些为人们做出贡献的动物们。鸡看到好朋友马被册封了，十分羡慕，于是就向马讨教方法。马打量了一眼鸡，说：“你的大嗓门不错啊。”鸡恍然大悟，于是天天早起打鸣（司晨），大声把熟睡的人们叫醒去耕作。时间长了，玉帝看到鸡表现不错，便也将鸡纳入生肖。

So, the questions is, how does the rooster become a member of the zodiac? Actually, the qualification of the rooster is closely related to our topic: **Crow of the Rooster**.

 >It is said that one day, the Jade Emperor(the emperor of heaven) would confer titles to 12 animals as the Chinese zodiac, mainly choosing the animals who made contributions to people. The rooster admired his good friend horse who have been knighted, so he turned to the horse for help. The horse looked at the rooster up and down, then said, “You have a great voice.”

 >The rooster took a tumble. From then on, the rooster crowed loudly every morning to wake up the sleeping people for work. Seeing the rooster doing so well, the Jade Emperor had the rooster into the Chinese zodiac.

Finally, tell you a little secret, this year is **the year of the rooster**. Do you want to know the traditional Chinese chronological table(dating method)? Do you want to know the ancient Chinese chronometry? Please continue to support us!
