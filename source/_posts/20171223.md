2017年12月19日，在年底的这个小尾巴，小觅有幸邀请到10位留学生，成功举办了第一次座谈会。小觅以往期公众号推送内容为基础，进行了一场有关“鸡”的小讲座，并且和留学生朋友们进行了良好的互动。会前准备的特色小零嘴（**蛋卷、瓜子、烤馍、花生米**）受到了一致好评。

通过问卷调查以及现场交流，小觅了解到了大家的兴趣点。所以小觅以后会和大家谈谈有趣的中国字，聊聊藏在成语里的故事，讲讲奇幻多彩的神话传说；也会带大家感受一下古韵古香的诗词魅力，欣赏一些中国古曲等等。只要你们一直支持，小觅就会持续介绍各种与中医相关的“中国文化之美”！

At the end of 2017, ChaseTCM was honoured to have 10 overseas students get together with us on December 19th. This is our first activity and it is successful. The theme is some stories about the rooster based on our previous public contents. We had a good interaction with each other. Also, the traditional Chinese snacks offered to this activity, including **egg rolls, sunflower seeds, Baked bun slice, and peanuts**, got a thumbs up.

Through the questionnaire and face-to-face communication, ChaseTCM got more ideas about everybody's interests. Therefore, we will talk about interesting Chinese characters, the stories hidden in idioms and colourful myths and legends. And we will also invite you to feel the charm of ancient Chinese poetry, ancient Chinese music and so on. As long as you support all through, ChaseTCM will continue to introduce all kinds of "Chinese Ancient Shining Enchantment" based on TCM and Chinese culture!
Finally, many thanks for your participation!
