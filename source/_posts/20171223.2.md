东晋时期有一个年轻人，名叫祖逖，他心怀抱负，希望能为国做出贡献。在一天夜里，天还没亮，他听到了公鸡打鸣的声音，认为公鸡这是在提醒他们要早点起来练剑，于是他叫醒了同伴刘琨，一起习武练剑。从此之后，他们每天早上只要听到鸡鸣就起床练剑，正是因为他们的勤奋，后来两个人都成了国家的将领，实现了他们为国效力的理想。于是也有了“**闻鸡起舞**”这个成语，意思是听到鸡的啼叫就起来舞剑，多用来比喻有志报国的人奋发努力。

In the Eastern-Jin Dynasty , there was a young man called Zu Ti ,who had a great ambition and wanted to contribute to the country. One night, when the sun had not risen, Zu was waked up by the crow of the rooster. Zu though that the rooster was reminding them to practice early, so he waked his partner Liu Kun up to practice martial art and play with the swords. From then on ,they played swords every morning with the crow. It's their hard working and diligence that made them to be great generals to contribute to their country. The idiom, **rising up upon hearing the crow of a rooster and practicing with the sword**(**++闻wén 鸡jī 起qǐ 舞wǔ++**), is now used to describe someone works hard to devote himself to the service of his country. 
   


小编说：
> 无论是“与鸡俱兴”还是“闻鸡起舞”，中华民族都在用自己的勤奋向世界传达着几千年的优良传统。看到这里，你是不是也默默设定了明天早早起床的闹钟了~~~
 
> Whether the suggestion from Huangdi Neijing, or the story of Zu Ti, the Chinese nation conveys our diligent tradition of the long history. Now it's time to set a alarm clock to get up early tomorrow.
