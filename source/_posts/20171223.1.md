在中国，有一本古老的医书——《黄帝内经》。这本书的基本素材来源于中国古人对生命现象的长期观察、大量的临床实践以及简单的解剖知识。~（引自百度百科）~《黄帝内经》呈现出的不仅是专业的中医学知识，还有很多适用于大众的养生文化，比如《内经》对于每天的作息时间，就给出了一些建议。

In China, there is an ancient Chinese medical book called Huangdi Neijing, which contents the Chinese ancients' long-term observation of the life phenomena, enormous clinical practice and simple anatomical knowledge. Not only professional knowledge of medicine, but also of health preservation was recorded in it. For example, it makes some suggestions on our work and rest time.

其实，无论是早睡还是晚睡，无论早起还是晚起，都是在建议我们的作息时间要跟着太阳走。因为春天和夏天，日照时间更长，白天的时间也就更长，所以睡觉时间应该更晚一些，早上起得更早一些，而夏天的白天比春天的还要长，所以古人还特意嘱咐了我们夏天要“**无厌于日**”，意思就是不要抱怨白天太长哦。到了冬天，由于天黑得比较早，所以需要早睡，而天亮得也稍晚些，所以就有了“早卧晚起”说法。

In fact, it's suggested that we should arrange our work and rest time according to the sun(time of sunrise and sunset). In spring and summer, because of the longer sunshine duration as well as the longer daytime, we are supposed to go to bed late and get up early. What's more, the daytime of summer is longer than spring's. So the Chinese ancient advised us **not to complain about the longer daylight during summer**. Contrarily, it gets dark early and gets bright late in winter because of the shorter sunshine duration, so we ought to go to bed early and get up late. 

那么，在没有闹钟的古代，古人如何判断起床时间呢？“雄鸡报晓”就是古人最好的闹钟。因为鸡的具体作息时间也不是固定的，一年四季各有不同，它们总会在天黑前入窝，天亮前起床。因为，一到黄昏，鸡的眼睛就开始视力模糊，看不清东西了，所以需要在天黑前回窝休息；而天亮之前，它们会以洪亮的嗓音早早地告诉人们：该起床啦！

So how do the ancient know when to get up without an alarm clock? The crow of the rooster is the best alarm clock. Although roosters have a specific sleeping schedule in each season, they always go back to the nest before dark and get up before dawn. Because the eyesight of roosters is decreased when night falls, they have to go to sleep. And next day they will get up and crow before sunrise to remind people to get up!
