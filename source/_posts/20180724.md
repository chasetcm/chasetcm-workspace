Soon, on the third Sunday of June, don’t forget to send best wishes to our fathers. When you love someone, let them know.

温馨提示：距离端午节还剩1天。

Warm tip: it will be only 1 day before the Dragon Boat Festival!

端午！！！又是一个可以愉快玩耍和吃吃吃的节日！

Dragon Boat Festival!!! It’s another excellent time to have fun and enjoy delicious food.

赛个龙舟，吃个粽子，挂个香包，戴串花绳，挂把艾蒿……

端午节，在每年农历五月初五，按照十二地支纪日法此为仲夏第一个午日，故名 “端午”。 

The Dragon Boat Festival, on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, is the first day of the  midsummer according to the calendar method of Twelve Earthly Branches.

端午节最最最重要的就是龙舟竞赛和吃粽子。其中流传最广的是为纪念中国历史上的爱国诗人——屈原。

It is the most important things to race dragon boat and eat zongzi on the Dragon Festival. The most popular version goes that people venerate Qu Yuan, a patriotic port in Chinese history.

屈原是楚国贵族，他才华横溢，很受楚王器重，但后来由于坚决反对楚王的一些政治策略，加之小人又乘机挑拨离间，逐渐被楚王疏远，最后惨遭流放。而他因不忍目睹楚国灭亡的悲剧，在五月初五投汨罗江自杀。人们争先驾舟去拯救沉江的屈原。后因舟身长，首尾装成龙形而得名“龙舟”。

Qu Yuan was a nobleman. He was trusted by the king of Chu because of his talent, but he firmly opposed the king’s political strategy and traitor minister sowed discord. So the king alienated exile him. And Qu Yuan was exiled in the end. He was unbearable to witness the collapse of the state of Chu. So he committed suicide by jumping into Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month. And people tried to rescue him by rowing their boats out to river. The boat is named after its long body decorated like a dragon.

而相传汨罗江中有蛟龙，人们担心蛟龙会吃屈原的尸体，便用竹筒子装米投于江中。后改为绿叶包米，并缠上彩丝线。

Legend has it, there are mythical flood dragons in Miluo River. People were afraid that them would eat Qu Yuan’s body. So they threw bamboo tubes filled with rice. Later they changed bamboo tubes to reed leaves and wrapped color yarn.

时至今日，粽子已经多种多样。简单来说，北方有甜粽子，南方有肉粽子。

At the present time, there is a great diversity of zongzi. In a nutshell, there are mainly sweet rice dumplings in the north and rice dumplings with meat in the south.

仔细看图的朋友们，有没有认出粽子里药食两用的宝贝呢？

Look at the pictures carefully！Do you recognize two dietetic Chinese herbs？

糯米，红枣。Bingo! 

Sticky rice and red dates.

在中医看来糯米甘而微温，可以健脾、补气、止泻等。附赠健脾止泻食疗方一首——糯米山药粥：糯米、淮山药各30g，共煮粥，熟后加适量白糖即可开吃。

In Chinese medicine, sticky rice is sweet and slightly warm and it can reinforce spleen, tonify Qi and have antidiarrheal effect. A Dietary therapy Recipe: 30 grams each sticky rice and dioscoreae rhizoma（shān yào）, boiled with water. Add white sugar to taste.

而红枣不仅可以补气，还可养血安神。所以民间又有“一天三个枣，百岁不见老”的俗语。而且红枣中富含维生素，故有“天然维生素丸” 之称。

Red dates not only tonify Qi but also nourish blood. As a Chinese idioms goes, eat three red dates every day, you will still look young when you are 100 years old. Red dates are rich in vitamin and have " the natural Vitamin pill” the name.

香包和艾草，是端午时节驱邪避毒的圣宝。你以为中药只能熬成一碗黑乎乎的汤药，那就大错特错了！端午的香包里装的就是中药呦！而门上挂的那把艾草或菖蒲，也是具有驱邪避毒的中药。而艾草还有招百福的美好寓意。小提示：端午是入夏后第一个节日。随着气温上升，记得预防夏季常见病，如空调病、热伤风、中暑、饮食不洁所导致的腹泻。

Sachets and wormwood are holy treasures to eliminate pathogens and anti-mosquito during midsummer. The traditional Chinese medicine can only boil into a bowl of black bitter soup, that is dead wrong! Duanwu sachet is filled with Chinese herbal medicine! And the wormwood （ài cǎo） or calamus     （chāng pǔ） hanging on the door is also a traditional Chinese medicine to eliminate pathogens and anti-mosquito. Besides, the wormwood also has the implied meaning of praying for good luck. Tip: Dragon Boat Festival is the first holiday since summer. With the temperature rising, please don't forget to prevent common disease in summer such as air-conditioner uncomfort, common cold due to wind heat, heatstroke and diarrhea due to unhygienic diet.

而戴在手腕和脚腕的花绳，同样也是人们为了祈祷安康。

当然端午的习俗不仅仅是这些，而且不同地区也有差异。

放松感受一下天津的端午节。粽子虽好，可不要贪吃太多呀！

What’s more, some decorations which are made by colorful ropes worn on the wrist and ankle are also used to pray for health.

Of course, there are still many customs of the Dragon Boat Festival, and it’s different in each region.

So please enjoy the festival in Tianjin. Buy the way, Zongzi will be delicious, but it will be not well to eat too much.
