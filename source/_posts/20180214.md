知道了闻鸡起舞的典故和生肖鸡的神话传说，那么“鸡”这个字，你会写了吗？

After knowing the story about “闻鸡起舞”(rising up upon hearing the crow of a rooster and practicing with the sword) and the myth of the rooster in Chinese zodiac, can you write the character of “鸡”(jī)? 


 “鸡”是一个象形字，从现在的样子往前追溯，看看最老的鸡长什么样？
 
The Chinese character “鸡”(jī) is a pictographic character. Comparing these four pictures, can you tell which one is the most ancient?

“鸡”是由左右两个部分组成，“又”是“奚（xī）”的简化写法，表声。“鸟”是表形。虽然鸡飞不到天上，但是和鸟一样，都是有翅膀的禽类。而且根据生物学分类，鸡属于鸟纲。


“鸡” is a left-right structural character. The left part is the simplified representation of the Chinese character “奚” (xī), which is a sound symbol. The right part “鸟” (means bird) is a pictograph. Although the rooster cannot fly in the sky, it is divided into Aves in biology, just as those birds with wings.
